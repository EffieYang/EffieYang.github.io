    <h1>Welcome to My Personal Website</h1>
  
    <p>As a graduate student in the Computer Science-Align program at Northeastern University, 
      I have developed proficiency in Python and Java, and I am also interested in machine learning.</p> 
    <p>My prior experience working full-time for six years at Mercedes Benz Group highlighted my ability to learn quickly, 
      solve problems actively, and approach tasks with patience and attention to detail.</p> 
    <p>During my time at the company, 
      I witnessed firsthand the importance and significance of automation and digitization in real-life work environments, 
      as Mercedes Benz underwent growth and transformation. I am currently seeking an internship opportunity to transition 
      into the technology industry, as I am eager to explore new areas of knowledge.</p>
